- add platforms
    - add custom image object
- add collision with top of platforms
- add momentum if player is in the air ( should add friction all the time and then have reduced friction while in the air)
Done - Prevent player from moving out of the left and right of the screen



Eventually

- create game engine based on this game (focus on physics)
