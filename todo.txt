- implement score
- fix physics
- get a more even distribution for platform spawns
- make mobile-compatible
- package using phonegap

Done - add game states (so that player starts on platform in the middle of the screen instead of on the ground)
Done - add collision with top of platforms (find a way to narrow collision detection to closest platform)
Done - add platforms
    Done - add custom image object
Done - Prevent player from moving out of the left and right of the screen

Issues:

3. player can still jump after they've died
4. sometimes player falls through platforms - not sure why

(fixed)
1. if players velocity is higher than height of platform he falls through it (fix)
2. Fix for above problem causes a gap between player and platform which is equal to player yvelocity at the time of collision detection
